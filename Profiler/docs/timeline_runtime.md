# Timeline invocation ownership

This describes implemented low-level runtime components, not an available
`--detail timeline` command. Public hook/CLI integration, clock certification,
canonical time events and Perfetto qualification remain separate work.

`timeline_runtime.TimelineOwnerPool` owns one independent record allocation per
invocation. `timeline_cuda_runtime.CudaTimelineTransport` supplies the actual
CUDA allocation, stream-local initialization, completion event and readback.
The common owner layer delegates physical storage planning to the transport;
it does not parse CUDA instructions or assume a warp/SM topology.

The collector binds the compiler plan to the actual loaded binary and function,
then calls `prepare` with the actual launch grid/device/stream. Both the single
allocation requirement and all pending physical bytes (including guard bytes)
must fit before allocation. `allocate` hands back the hidden launch buffer.
Immediately before invoking the launcher, `mark_submitting` conservatively
records that work may be submitted. After it returns, `finish_submission`
records a completion event on that invocation's stream. It does not wait.

Only after submissions does the collector call `read`, validate/decode/persist
the returned immutable raw bytes, then `release` that owner. The live owner
snapshots the plan, selection, binary, grid and stream, so later invocations do
not overwrite its metadata. Separate CUDA streams and many pending invocations
are supported by this component; its pool is restricted to the creating host
Thread object. This does not declare the legacy instrumentation hook to have
acquired those capabilities.

Initialization may itself submit writes. Consequently, `abort` can immediately
remove an admitted owner without an allocation, but an armed or possibly
submitted owner first needs a stream completion proof. A timeout retains the
same handle and resource for a later poll; it does not mean the writer stopped.
Completion-query/recording errors quarantine the owner. Readback failures retain
the allocation and allow `retry_read` without executing the application again.
An active-owner registry prevents loss of the caller's Python reference from
silently freeing pending buffers; `retained_owner_statuses()` reports retained
pools. This retention is deliberate and may hold memory until explicit recovery
or process/context teardown; `close` reports an error while owners remain.

The `read` timeout bounds completion polling. A blocking driver/D2H operation
still needs the enclosing owned process deadline; Python cannot safely reclaim
that memory by cancelling a thread. CUDA graph capture is rejected before this
component allocates. The CUDA transport must run on the declared current device
and uses the actual launch stream for both initialization and completion.

Tests: `tests/timeline/test_timeline_runtime.py` covers safety contracts with a
fake transport (not device evidence). `p01_nvidia_deferred_owners.py` runs real
ordinary recurrence math, six interleaved launches on two CUDA streams with no
collector wait/read between them, reverse-order readback, budget rejection and
recovery. It checks numerical outputs, original side-effect counts, separate
in-flight allocations, canaries and decoded raw identity. This development test
does not certify physical clock/epoch, final machine timing boundaries,
hardware overlap, public profiler integration or complete P01.
